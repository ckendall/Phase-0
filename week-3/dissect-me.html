      <h1>How I Learned to Git</h1>
      <h2>December 6, 2015</h2>
      <p>
        So this is week 1 of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 and I've learned several things I didn't know before. I've learned how to actually use my command line. Prior to this I simply copied and pasted from the web whenever the need arose and just put faith in the commands people were giving me. Now I can actually, albeit not master level, understand what such commands do - somewhat. One of things I got most excited to say I know how to use now is git and GitHub.

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	I used footer, and section for this challenge. I continue to come back to footer because it is a really descriptive element that I know what do to with it. It is just like <header> that I love to use because there is no confusion of where they should go and what they are describing. 

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The elements get laid out on the page by their hierarcy. The computer runs down through the code to see exactly what is doing. First it goes from the top to see what kind of document that it is working with and then continues on looking for titles and body elements. Once it sees those, it knows that is what needs to be put out on the screen and how it should be put out. The elements tell the computer what the page should look like. For example <section> denotes to the computer that the whole next lines of code are together and to know to keep them there while we are typing out more lines.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned that hitting tab after typing a certain key phrase it will spit out what ever that key phrase is relating to. It was pretty awesome to see that happen. I think that it would be awesome to create more snippets, especially when I know I will be using more code and don't need to actually write everything out. Researching some shortcuts would be fun in my spare time and I would need to learn where to find them and their uses. That would be fun as well
