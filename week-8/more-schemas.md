I believe this is a one to one because I have one Lisence number associated with that truck and there is only one of those lisences in the line of trucks so it should be a one to one. I guess I don't really get it, but that is the best example I could think of.

#What is a one-to-one database?
A one to one data base has one particular item that could have a separate table if it needed but the other table could be left with NULL in it. This one is a little confusing to me, but that is what I think it is.

#When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
I think we would use one to one, in general, because it would be easier to access the primary data than to go deeper in the data if we don't need to. If there is a unique property that we want then we can access it if we need to.

#What is a many-to-many database?
This is where we have multiple tables pointing to multiple IDs.

#When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
We could use this to keep track everything that is related to one another. 

#What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
Um pretty much everything is confusing about database schemeas. I think I need someone to sit down with me and explain it to me in a little different way that would make sense to me. The only thing that kind of makes sense is the one to many, but that is still a stretch for me to say that it makes sense.
