<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- What did you learn about the DOM?
  Well I learned that I can see everything that is changing in my template and I can also see real-time what is going on. It is quite a useful tool in order to plan the site accordingly.
What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM? -->
<!-- the ones that we used mostly were document.getElementById(), document.getElementByClassName(), and document.getElementByTagName(). These fetch from the document what we want and then we can manipulate them with these: .style, .textFont, .style.backgroundColor, and a variety of many many more. -->
