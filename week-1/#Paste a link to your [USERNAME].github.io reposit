#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
First I would explain to them that in order to create a repository they would need to click the plus sign button at the top right side of the GitHub page and then click new repository. Then all one has to do is create a name, whether it be public or not, add a license if they wish and click create repository. In order to clone it they would need to go to GitHub and click into their repository and highlight the URL next to HTTPS://. With the highlighted text copy that. click into their terminal and type git clone URL. replacing URL with the copied text. 

#Describe what open source means.
Open source means that the code that is put out and is anyone has the ability to look at it anytime and change whatever they see fit. 

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think that open source is an extremely cool idea. It allows people to share ideas without hassel. We should be able to share ideas and code to help out everyone else!

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Using licenses is important because it can still give the control back to the orginal coder. it gives them credit for it so no one can go off and steal their ideas and use them for their own personal gain. Although some licenses let people take the code and profit off of it, they just have to have the license attached to it. its a good idea. 

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I am getting more stable in posting to GitHub from git. I didn't have any "aha" moments but seeing my HTML site was super cool. I am still struggling with branching a little bit.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did not find any outside resources that were of help to me.
