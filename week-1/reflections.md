# 1.1 Think About Time


Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
There were time management and productivities that I have already had in my life and didn't even know I was using them. One time management technique that I have not heard of was the pomodoro technique. I found this to, potentially, be extremely powerful to split up tasks into smaller chunks of time while avoiding distractions and taking a break after. I have found that working for a period of time and then taking a break really works for me, and I would like to try and do that a little more. Another time management technique that I have learned about was in the article Productivity by Jonathan. He talked about giving yourself less time in order to accomplish more. If I have objectives to complete - see what I can do by that time. As for productivity ideas meditation was one that I have never thought about, but in the blog by Belle Beth Cooper, she explained a lot about how it will calm the brain down and I found it fascinating. Then in Productivity Jonathan touched on a lot of material that really spoke to me. He was explaining that productivity doesn't have to be a measurable result it just has to have meaning to me. He also wrote about having self-worth and we can get down because we didn't accomplish something, but to remember that we still have ourselves and that is what counts. 

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
From what I understand time boxing to be is creating a set time to work on a certain project and having it be the same time for all sets. Say I am doing a project I give my self 10 minutes then a reflection stage to see what has been accomplished then continue on with the sequence until the project is accomplished or the feeling of success has been met for the day. I can see myself using this in Phase 0 because I know I can get frustrated because I am not seeing progress in my work, but if I were to time box it I would be able to reflect on what I have done and feel good about what I have done. I would need to figure a good time frame for my box and that would take a little bit to match up with my attention span.

How do you manage your time currently?
As of right now I have a loose schedule that I follow and a wife that helps me with be accountable for my actions regarding Dev Bootcamp. She helped me create a time table with how many hours a day I need to be working on coding and it has helped me keep on track. After the day is done I write down how long I have worked and it lets me see what I have done in the day.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
It is the best strategy that I have had in my life so far. I haven't felt motivated to do something like this for as long as I have. It keeps me on track, for the most part, but unfortunately most of my work comes in the morning, which I do not enjoy, but it has to be done. Other than that It has been great for me. 

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I would like to try out meditation and pomodoro time box. Those seem like they would be the most effective for me. I would like to do more meditation to clear my mind when I get frustrated. Time boxing would help me not get frustrated because I can see progress and have meditation at the end of each period.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
My overall plan for Phase 0 is to keep my strategy that I have already, but add some more time to it in order to accomplish all of what I need to do. I will also try and add in meditation and pomodoro in the afternoon sessions. I plan to study a few hours a day and meditate, because I am new to it, for a couple of minutes to get a feel for it.

# 1.2 The Command Line


What is a shell? What is "bash?"
From my understanding shell is the user interface and how one navigates around the terminal and "bash" is the underlying factor of shell. It is what runs the programs and how one can make the shell look. I'm not all too certain if that is entirely correct, but that is how I interpreted it.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging for me is remembering all of what I can do and how to do it. Basically all of it, I know that I can do so many cool things from the terminal and I am new to it all so knowing how to maneuver it is going to take a little time to figure it out.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
I was able to successfully use most of them, but not understand them all the way.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
The one that I seem to use most was ls and cd, I know how to use them fairly well so as of right now I believe those are the most important
