#What is a wireframe?
Wireframing is an extremely useful tool that lets one map out their entire website before they even think about what kind of pictures and cool looking gadets need to look like. It is essentially a bare bones website. I am able to look at my, however pitiful, wireframe and know kind of what I need to have in it and where I need to put it.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
The benefits of wireframing can be great if one uses it right. It allows the designer to see how they would like to make the site without putting it together. In other words they are able to move things around a lot easier. The tool that I used was very basic and I was ablt to move my body and footer around if I didn't like where it was with out too much hassel. That's what I'm trying to say, it is easy to make changes to the site because nothing has actually been made. That is the biggest benefits that I took away from this challenge.

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I didn't particulary enjoy wireframing, just for that fact that I had no Idea what I was doing or where I should put things. I watched and looked at a lot of examples, but still didn't have a single clue of what to do. In the end my wireframe is not what I want and I'm sure I will adjust it again and again. 

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I didn't stick with my first idea. I moved things around and I tried to get creative with it but I don't think that it worked very well. 

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
Oh I had a ton of questions during this one. I didn't know how to get my wireframe site to a file that I could save, I didn't know how to make a wireframe, really, In turn of all that I asked how to do a screen shot of the site so it was easier to capture. It was a rough time on this one. The resources that I had were my roommates. They are actual web designers so I asked them how I can save files, screen captures, what good wireframes actually look like. Everything that I could ask they were so kind to help me with. 


#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
This challenge was all pretty tedious for me, I can see if I had a little bit better tools to make a good wireframe, or maybe the tools I have were just fine and I didn't know it, but I just didn't enjoy it all too much. I'm not that creative to make things, so it takes me a long time to come up with ideas for it and that is something that I would like to work on in the future.
