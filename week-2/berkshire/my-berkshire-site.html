<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I have very little HTML experience so my previous learning was seeing and typing and hoping that it worked, but seeing it on paper so to speak is super cool. I will work on it and get better every time I use it.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researhing is always fun and I really love to do it. I love seeing new and possibly better ways to do things. HTML5 elements seem to be better, however, I have not put them to practice. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I did well, no formatting needed to be done in this kind of work. Well I'm sure there could have been but I didn't need to do any of it. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seem to be good for putting together some simple ideas and links and pictures and it is relatively simple to learn. The bad part about it seem that it is quite tedious to code in. It may be simple but I find it way more tedious than say Ruby. There's no logic solving in it. HTML is what it is and what you see. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I have found that for lists and tables its pretty straight forward. <ul> mean unordered list, <tr> is for a table row. all of the prefixes before typing pretty much sums up what one will be typing.
