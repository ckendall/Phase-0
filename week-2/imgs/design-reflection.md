#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The six phases of web desing are as follows:
1.Information Gathering- This is where we gather all the information that we need in order to achieve our customers goal. We need to ask a lot of questions. Purpose? Goals? Target Audience? Content? We want to know what we are doing in order to even start designing the site.

2.Planning- With the informatioin gathered we can start planning our site. We want to know what goes where. From the Home page do we want drop down menus or do we want a menu on the side. Where is everything going to go and what are the main topics of the site as well as the sup topics? That is what this stage is all about. 

3.Design- This is the look of the site. From the information gathered we will design it properly. Who is it going to? who is it tageted at? These questions asked will have a dramatic affect on how the site will look.

4.Development- This is where the site actually takes shape. 

5. Testing and Delivery- This stage we make sure that we have valid code and the site does what it suppose to do. If there is problems in testing go back and fix it. Once the code is approved then the files are uploaded to a server the site should be put through on last run to make sure it is setup correctly. 

6. Maintenance- This step offers the ability to edit content that may seem out of date or just needs a little revision or you want a new page to the site that wasn't thought of in the beginning. You can also use the time for backups, upgrades, new plugins and so on. Maintenance is what you want to make of it. 

#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site is to further introduce me and and let everyone who visits it see me and read about me. Links to my Facebook and Linkedin account will be there so they can see where I've worked and my social setting as well. I want them to feel like they have seen me and recogize me before I meet them. Like old friends meeting for the first time, one of those situations. 

#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
I see my target audience's interests as people who want to get to know me and see where I have been and what I have done. I see my site addressing that by giving them all of the links to photos of where I have been and my job history along with my blog and a little "about me" section. 

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
My primary action would be for them to have an easily searchable site so that they can find all of the information that they need along with a way to contact me if they have any further questions. My links to social media, blog, about me, and photo should be all they need, but if not there will be a way to contact me. 

#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
I never thought about this, but I think someone should know the stages of design, espcially information gathering. that plays a crucial role in what the site is going to do, look like, feel like, all of the above. UX(user experience), I feel, is important because it shows we as a designer are thinking about our customer and how they feel while using the website. UX is all about the user having a good experience with the site and that is the biggest concept that I think someone should know about user experience. Make the user feel good while they are spending the time to use your site. They will come back if they have a good time.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is making the design of the website suit the needs and feelings of the person using the site. it is valuable because it makes the person using the site feel like they aren't trying to navigate a complex, pretty, site. It is also helps show what people want, different colors for a button might attract more people to click it, a cool drop down menu, or side bars, whatever it is that people want. It helps out who ever is running the site for revenue reasons and having people come back, extremely valuable.  

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I had a hard time with the websites for my site mapping and getting it on to a file I could use. I'm new to mac so having it go to the clipboard where I could access it was difficult for me. I researched it and got help from a roommate and finally got it down but then I couldn't upload it right so I proceeded to just take a picture and do it that way. I will find a way to do it, but just could quite get it at this time.
