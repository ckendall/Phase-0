#What does puts do?
Puts is a command that prints out to the screen what the code does. I know that was terrible explaination. So here is an example. If, in ruby code I have the equation 3+7 and I have puts in front of it like this puts 3+7, that will print out to the screen 10 and create a new line. 

#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is any real number like 1,2,3,4,5 and a float is a decimal number 1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0.

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
To them I would say that interger division in ruby works in whole numbers, it will not give you a value and a remainder. Example 7/3 would return 2 because it doesn't know how to handle the remainder. In float division ruby can handle that. Example 7/3.0 would return 2.33333333 and so on. 

number_of_hours_in_a_year_equation = (24/1.0)(365/1.0)
number_of_minutes_in_a_decade_equation = (60/1.0)*(24/1.0)*(365/1.0)*(10/1.0)
