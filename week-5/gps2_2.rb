#What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
# I learned that it's good to know all that one is working with. I forgot a whole
# step in the program so when I tried to start something was missing. Try to figure
# out what all you are working with and then start. 

#What are the tradeoffs of using Arrays and Hashes for this challenge?
# The tradeoff with Arrays and Hashes for this challenge was that the Hash
# was a lot easier to work with because we have a key and a value. With Arrays
# it is really hard to combine those two and add numbers to the specific ones
# that one wants to add to

#What does a method return?
# A method will implicitly return the last line of code that was written
# unless the coder wants to return something in the middle of the code.
# which is unusal, but it will happen in an IF statemnt, for example.

#What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
# All sorts of things. One can pass variables, strings, numbers, hashes
# basically any object can be passed into a method as an argument.

#How can you pass information between methods?
# The way that I found was to create a variable with the return of one method and 
# then that variable and be tossed to one method or another. There is also
# a way to make a variable global and then one would be able to call it anywhere.

#What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
# I liked that I got to see how to pass variables through methods again. I had 
# lost that knowledge from not using it for some time. I know I still need to work
# on the logic piece a little more and finding out how to work through Hashes and 
# arrays like I want to.
